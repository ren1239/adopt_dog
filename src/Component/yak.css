Your CardList and Card components are well-structured to handle a list of dogs and to display information about each dog in individual cards. However, there's a small adjustment needed in the Card component to ensure that the click event is correctly handled:

Attach the onClick Event to the Card:
In the Card component, you need to attach the onCardClick prop to the onClick event of the card div. This ensures that the handleClick function in CardList is called when a card is clicked.
Here's the updated Card component:

jsx
Copy code
import "./Card.css";

function Card({ dog, onCardClick, isSelected }) {
  const { name, age, picture } = dog; // Assuming `picture` is a property of `dog`

  // Determine the card's className based on whether it's selected
  const cardClasses = isSelected ? "card selected" : "card";

  // Return Statement
  return (
    <div className={cardClasses} onClick={onCardClick}> {/* Added onClick event here */}
      <div className="picture">
        <img src={picture} alt={`Picture of ${name}`} />
      </div>
      <div className="info">
        <h3>{name}</h3>
        <p>{age}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
In this update:

The onClick event is attached to the top-level div of the Card component.
onCardClick (passed from CardList) is used as the event handler for the click event.
Everything else in your components looks good. Ensure that your Dogs array and the Card component are properly structured to handle the dog object's properties (like name, age, and picture). The picture property should contain the URL to the dog's image.

Once you've made this change, clicking on a card will trigger the handleClick function in CardList, which will update the state and cause the selected card to be highlighted.

            <Card
              dog={dog}
              key={dog.id}
              isSelected={dog.id === selectedCard}
              onCardClick={() => handleClick(dog.id)}
            />
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CardList;

Your CardList component looks mostly correct, but there's a small issue in your handleClick function that needs to be addressed to ensure it works as intended.

The purpose of handleClick is to set the selectedCard state to the ID of the clicked card, or unset it if the same card is clicked again (to toggle the selection on and off). However, the current implementation of your handleClick function doesn't quite achieve this. Let's fix that:

jsx
Copy code
function CardList() {
  // State to track the ID of the selected card
  const [selectedCard, setSelectedCard] = useState(null);

  // Function to handle card click
  const handleClick = (id) => {
    // Toggle the selected state on or off
    setSelectedCard(selectedCard === id ? null : id);
  };

  // JSX for rendering the component
  return (
    <div className="card-body"> {/* Corrected the class name */}
      <h3>Looking for Love?</h3>
      <div className="card-list">
        {Dogs.slice(0, 3).map((dog) => (
          <Card
            dog={dog}
            key={dog.id}
            isSelected={dog.id === selectedCard}
            onCardClick={() => handleClick(dog.id)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
